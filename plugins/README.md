Plugins for events and parsing of messages
==========================================

Make your own plugins
---------------------
Make your own plugins to be able to:

+ Parse the message content and trigger actions.
+ Filter/alter the message content before inserted into logfile.

This is how you do it:

+ Go to code base dir.
+ Go to plugins dir.
+ Copy boilerplate.js to your own file. Must end with .js
+ Hack away with your plugin :)
